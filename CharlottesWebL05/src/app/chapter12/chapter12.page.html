  <h1> Before Breakfast </h1>
  <p> 
    Tears ran down her cheeks and she took hold of the ax
    and tried to pull it out of her father's hand.
    "Fern," said Mr. Arable, "I know more about raising
    a litter of pigs than you do. A weakling makes trouble.
    Now run along!"
    "But it's unfair," cried Fern. "The pig couldn't help
    being born small, could it? If I had been very small at
    birth, would you have killed me?"
    Mr. Arable smiled. "Certainly not," he said, looking
    down at his daughter with love. "But this is different.
    A little girl is one thing, a little runty pig is another."
    "I see no difference," replied Fern, still hanging on
    to the ax. "This is the most terrible case of injustice I
    ever heard of."
    A queer look came over John Arable's face. He
    seemed almost ready to cry himself.
    "All right," he said. "You go back to the house and
    I will bring the runt when I come in. I'll let you start
    it on a bottle, like a baby. Then you'll see what trouble
    a pig can be."
    When Mr. Arable returned to the house half an
    hour later, he carried a carton under his arm. Fern was
    upstairs changing her sneakers. The kitchen table was
    set for breakfast, and the room smelled of coffee, bacon,
    damp plaster, and wood smoke from the stove.
    "Put it on her chair!" said Mrs. Arable. Mr. Arable
    set the carton down at Fern's place. Then he walked 
</p>

  <p>
    to the sink and washed his hands and dried them on the
    roller towel.
    Fern came slowly down the stairs. Her eyes were
    red from crying. As she approached her chair, the
    carton wobbled, and there was a scratching noise. F em
    looked at her father. Then she lifted the lid of the carton. There, inside, looking up at her, was the newborn
    pig. It was a white one. The morning light shone
    through its ears, turning them pink.
    "He's yours," said Mr. Arable. "Saved from an untimely death. And may the good Lord forgive me for
    this foolishness."
    Fern couldn't take her eyes off the tiny pig. "Oh,"
    she whispered. "Oh, look at him! He's absolutely perfect."
    She closed the canon carefully. First she kissed her
    father, then she kissed her mother. Then she opened
    the lid again, lifted the pig out, and held it against
    her cheek. At this moment her brother A very came
    into the room. A very was ten. He was heavily armed
    -an air rifle in one hand, a wooden dagger in the
    other.
    "What's that?" he demanded. "What's Fern got?"
    11She's got a guest for breakfast," said Mrs. Arable.
    11Wash your hands and face, Avery!"
    "Let's see it!" said Avery, setting his gun down.
    uy ou call that miserable thing a pig? That's a fine 
</p>


<p>
  "Please don't kill it!" she sobbed. "It's unfair."
  Mr. Arable stopped walking.
  "Fern," he said gently, "you will have to learn to
  control yourself."
  "Control myself?" yelled F em. "This is a matter of
  life and death, and you talk about controlling myself."
